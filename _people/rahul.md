### About

I am an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering
([ECE](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/)) at the University of California, San Diego
([UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/)), which I joined in 2024. From 2022 to 2024, I was a
Postdoctoral Researcher at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)), hosted by [Michael
Unser](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/unser/). I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical
Engineering in 2022 at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison
([UW&ndash;Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/)), where I was supervised by [Robert
D. Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/). I completed my undergraduate studies at
the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities ([UMN](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/))
in 2018, where I received a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Computer Science.

I am interested in the interplay between **functional and harmonic analysis**
and **data science**---broadly defined---and their applications to problems in
**signal processing**, **machine learning**, **statistics**, and
**optimization**. In particular, my research focuses on the following areas:

- **foundations of neural networks and deep learning**

  - mathematical characterizations of functions and representations learned from data
  - approximation properties of neural networks
  - nonparametric function estimation with neural networks

- **mathematics of data science**

  - sparsity and compressed sensing
  - optimal recovery and minimax estimation
  - wavelet-based signal processing and statistics

- **functional and harmonic analysis**
  - Radon transforms and their generalizations
  - wavelets, their generalizations, and other kinds of space-scale or time-frequency analysis
  - optimization problems over Banach spaces and more general topological vector spaces

For more detailed information about my research, you can take a look at my
[papers](/papers/) or my [CV](/files/rahulparhi-cv.pdf).
