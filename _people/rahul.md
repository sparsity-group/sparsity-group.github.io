### About

I am an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering
([ECE](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/)) at the University of California, San Diego
([UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/)), which I joined in 2024. From 2022 to 2024, I was a
Collaborateur Scientifique (a.k.a. Postdoctoral Researcher) at the École
Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)). I
completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 2022 at the University of
Wisconsin&ndash;Madison ([UW&ndash;Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/)). I completed
my undergraduate studies at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities
([UMN](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/)) in 2018, where I received a B.S. in
Mathematics and a B.S. in Computer Science.

I am interested in the interplay between **functional and harmonic analysis**
and **data science**---broadly defined---and their applications to **signal
processing**, **machine learning**, **statistics**, and **optimization**. In
particular, my research focuses on the following areas:

- **foundations of neural networks and deep learning**
  - mathematical characterizations of functions and representations learned from
    data
  - approximation properties of neural networks
  - nonparametric function estimation with neural networks
  - function spaces and representation costs of neural networks
- **mathematics of data science**
  - sparsity and compressed sensing
  - optimal recovery, information-based complexity, and minimax estimation
  - wavelet-based signal processing and inverse problems more generally
  - mathematical statistics and information theory
- **pure and applied aspects of functional and harmonic analysis**
  - Radon transforms and their generalizations
  - wavelets, their generalizations, and other kinds of space-scale or
    time-frequency analysis
  - optimization and convex analysis on Banach spaces and more general
    topological vector spaces
  - geometry of (quasi-)Banach spaces

Almost all of my research is fundamentally motivated by problems data science
and, in particular, our (lack of) understanding of neural networks. Improving
our understanding there is a principal outstanding problem. What is particularly
fascinating is that, in many instances, once a research question is stripped of
the "applied language", one is left with a fundamental question in pure
mathematics. As a result, my research touches on and also contributes to various
areas of pure mathematics. From this perspective, data science is an extremely
exciting area to be working in as it is the best of two worlds: Beautiful
mathematics that leads to meaningful real-world impact.
