title: Papers
description: A list of papers is also available on <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5A_1NL0AAAAJ'><b>Google Scholar</b></a>.<br/><br/>We are fortunate to work with a diverse set of collaborators across various disciplines. Each of these disciplines follows different conventions for deciding on authorship order. However, these are just thatâ€”conventions. The true value of each contribution, however you define it, is often difficult to quantify. In that spirit, think of every project below as a result of a "team" effort, where every "player" brings their strengths to the field. Functionally, what this means is that some papers have authors listed in contributional order, while others list them in alphabetical order.
