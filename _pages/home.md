The **S**ignals, **P**atterns, **A**daptivity, **R**egularization,
**S**tatistics, and **I**nformation **T**heor**Y** (SPARSITY) research group at
the University of California, San Diego ([UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/)), led by
[Rahul Parhi](/rahul/), pursues fundamental research at the interface between
**signal processing**, **machine learning**, **statistics**, and
**optimization**.

Our research efforts often overlap with many areas of **applied mathematics**
including applied harmonic analysis, approximation theory, inverse problems,
stochastic processes, the theory of distributions, time--frequency analysis, and
wavelets. As a by-product, we have also made several contributions to these
areas as well. For more information, please take a look at our
[papers](/papers/).

**&#9733; We are always interested in recruiting <ins>self-motivated</ins> Ph.D.
students and postdocs with a <ins>strong background in mathematics</ins> who are
generally interested in the mathematics of data science. If you are interested
in joining us, please send an email to [Rahul Parhi](/rahul/) with (i)
your CV and (ii) a list of topics you are interested in.**
